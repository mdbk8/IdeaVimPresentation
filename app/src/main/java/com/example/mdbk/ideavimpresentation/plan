Show how to turn on/off plugin
Say about conflict with default shortcut
Show 'Shortcut conflicts' in Preferences


Why this presentation:
- you don't have to move your fingers from QWERTY keyboard to arrows (it really makes a huge difference :)
- IDE after installation recommends IDEAVim plugin as a very few plugins to install
- you can combine two worlds: old one (vim) and new one (IDE shortcuts)
- a lot of refactoring commands I will show can also be done using IDE shortcuts,
    but with VIM they are even more quicker to do
- combined with IDE shortcuts you can (almost) throw away your mouse
- knowledge how to use Vim will never expire
- you can, at least, feel like a PRO ;)




examples


combo example with different refactorings

How to approach learning:
- start just with basic navigation using 'j', 'k', 'k', 'l'
- edit your code 'depricated' way and use vim command when you notice a chance to use it
- give you some time to begin feeling comfortable with switching between modes
- every time you have to use arrows combined with delete button stop for a moment
and look for 'command' that does that much quicker
- keep a list of 'commands' nearby


- gives you a language to express changes you want to make in a concise, easy and efficient way


- the goal is to modify code very quickly without thinking much about it


- Why you should give a talk for the first (or second) time?
    - because we as a community care about you experience, not about new stuff/hype
        (like coroutines, arrow library)
    - everyone has some interesting cases at work worth sharing
    - it doesn't have to be long for 30/40 minutes (15 minutes talks are also fine)
    - we need new speakers
    - let's make our local community even more awesome


at the end show link to repo and say to share feedback by creating PR with bug ;)


- install Presentation Assistant plugin
- enable KeyCastr
- adjust font size

Phrases:

- Vim with plugins is the biggest competitor for JetBrains
